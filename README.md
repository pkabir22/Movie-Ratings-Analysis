# Movie Ratings Analysis

I collected a dataset of movie rating from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ which contains 2 csv files: movies.csv and ratings.csv.

I conducted data exploration, cleaning, analysis and visualization to show some basic statistics of the dataset and concluded by showing the most popular movie and the highest rated movie.
